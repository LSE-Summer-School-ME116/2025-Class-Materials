## **Question 1**
The file $\texttt{midterm.csv}$ contains a sample of 100 midterm exam scores from students who took this course in the period 2011-17.
```{r}
midt <- read.csv("D:/R data/midterm.csv") # replace this with your own path
midt[1:10,]  # select the first ten observations
```
```{r}
colnames(midt)
```
```{r}
score <- midt$x  # define a variable score which is the x column of midt
score
```

### **(a)**
Compute the mean and median exam scores.
```{r}
mean(score)  # mean score
sum(score) / length(score)  # alternative way
```
```{r}
median(score)  # median score
```

### **(b)**
Compute the quartiles and interquartile range, then draw a box plot of the data.
```{r}
summary(score)  # summary of the data
```
```{r}
quantile(score, 0.25)  # 1st quartile
quantile(score, 0.75)  # 3rd quartile
quantile(score, 0.5)  # median
```
```{r}
IQR <- quantile(score, 0.75)  - quantile(score, 0.25)  # IQR of the data
boxplot(score)  # box plot
boxplot(score, main = "Boxplot of the midterm scores", ylab = "score")
```

### **(c)**
Compute the standard deviation of the scores. What proportion os students scored within 2 standard deviations of the mean? 
```{r}
sd(score)  # standard deviation of the data
sqrt( sum( (score - mean(score)) ^2) / (length(score) - 1) )  # alternative way
```

```{r}
m_2sdl <- mean(score) - 2 * sd(score)  # mean - 2*sd
m_2sdh <- mean(score) + 2 * sd(score)  # mean + 2*sd
m_2sdl
m_2sdh
```

```{r}
score > m_2sdh  # check whether each score is above mean + 2*sd
sum(score > m_2sdh)  # count how many scores are above mean + 2*sd
```

```{r}
score < m_2sdl  # check whether each score is below mean - 2*sd
sum(score < m_2sdl)  # count how many scores are below mean - 2*sd
```

```{r}
length(score) - sum(score > m_2sdh) - sum(score < m_2sdl)  # how many scores are between mean - 2*sd and mean + 2*sd
```

### **(d)**
Draw a histogram of exam scores and comment on its shape.
```{r}
hist(score)  # histogram
```
Some evidence of $\textbf{left skew}$, due to the upper bound at 100.

```{r}
hist(score, breaks = 15, col = 'light blue')  
```

### **(e)**
Using the histogram you have drawn, estimate the probability that a randomly chosen student: 

- passes the course;
- obtains a grade of A- or higher
```{r}
letter <- read.csv("D:/R data/letter_grades.csv") # replace this with your own path
letter
```
```{r}
sum(score >= 40) / length(score)
sum(score >= 65) / length(score)
```

## **Question 2**
Find a recent example in a newspaper/magazine/blog of a plot that is confusing or misleading. Suggests ways to improve it (or draw an improved plot!)

In $\textit{Financial Times}$, this chart was described as “[One of the worst charts ever](https://www.ft.com/content/58dce921-2cdf-4140-9eb7-77792749dc88).” In an article by ABC encouraging the rental of vacant homes to ease the housing crisis, a line chart was used:
```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/R data/Australia.png")
```

But there were several design problems:

- The label of x axis was unclear: The “total” (overall number) was placed on the same axis as regional indicators, making the comparison meaningless;
- A line chart was used instead of a more appropriate bar chart for categorical comparison.
